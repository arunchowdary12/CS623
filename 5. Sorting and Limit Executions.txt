SELECT * FROM locations
ORDER BY name ASC
LIMIT 5;

Analysis: This SQL query retrieves data from the "locations" table, sorting the results in ascending order based on the "name" column and limiting the output to the first 5 rows using the LIMIT clause. The analysis indicates that the intention is to obtain a concise list of the first five locations alphabetically sorted by name. This approach is commonly used to quickly retrieve and display a small subset of data for preview or initial analysis.
