CREATE INDEX idx_feature_type ON locations(feature_type);

Analysis: The SQL statement creates an index named "idx_feature_type" on the "feature_type" column of the "locations" table. Indexing the "feature_type" column can significantly improve the execution time of queries that involve filtering or sorting based on this column. This optimization allows the database engine to locate and retrieve relevant data more efficiently, particularly when searching for specific feature types in the "locations" table.
